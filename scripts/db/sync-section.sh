# Production is upstream for everything the site writes -- corpus edits and takes -- so
# data only ever flows droplet -> here. This is the one recipe for all three sections: the
# section's corpus tables whole, and its rows of the shared tables -- `take`, and the voice
# actors' `recording` (migration 0062), which the acted packs are built from. It replaced a
# quests `sync`, a books `db-pull` that fetched takes but not the text they were cut from,
# and a zones `db-pull`/`db-push` pair written against a table and a Docker database that
# no longer exist.
#
# Environment, as the Makefiles pass it:
#   DROPLET, SSH, REMOTE_ROOT   how to reach production (make/droplet.mk)
#   LOCAL_DB                    the database to replace into
#   SOURCE_DB                   instead of the droplet, dump from this database directly --
#                               for rehearsing the sync against a local copy
