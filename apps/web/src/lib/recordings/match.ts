/**
 * Which line an uploaded file is a recording of, by its name.
 *
 * An actor records a session's worth of lines and drops the folder on the page, so the name
 * is all there is to go on. Each section's name for a file is its addon path flattened to
 * one segment, which is also what a recording is called when somebody downloads it:
 *
 *   quests  quests/33-accept.mp3       33-accept.ogg    (m-/f- prefixes are their own files)
 *           gossip/31ab….mp3           31ab….mp3
 *   zones   1411/razor-hill            1411-razor-hill.mp3
 *           947/zone                   947-zone.mp3     (every map has a `zone`, so the map
 *                                                        id has to be in the name)
 *   books   1381                       1381.mp3
 *
 * Browser-safe: the drop zone names files with it before anything is sent.
