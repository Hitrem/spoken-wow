/**
 * loadDirtyContext() against a real Postgres: what it has to get right is that the sweep
 * sees one change per word however many times the word was saved, because the log grows with
 * every save and the sweep is paid per take per change.
 *
 * Every row is written under a language no site serves, and removed after each case.
 *
 * Needs DATABASE_URL and the migrations applied.
