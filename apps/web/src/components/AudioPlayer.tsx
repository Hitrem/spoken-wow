/**
 * The transport bar both sections play through.
 *
 * ONE <audio> FOR THE WHOLE PAGE. Starting a line therefore stops the previous one with no
 * bookkeeping across rows -- the alternative, an element per row, means tracking which are
 * playing and pausing them by hand, and getting that wrong sounds like two narrators talking
 * over each other.
 *
 * The element stays a plain <audio> handed back through `audioRef`, because both explorers
 * drive playback imperatively from the keyboard (space toggles, j/k step). The chrome here is
 * presentation over that element, never a replacement for it.
 *
 * WHERE A MISSING FILE IS REPORTED. A take is a row in the database, and nothing asks the
 * filesystem whether its bytes are reachable while a page renders -- so the first thing that
 * knows a clip is not there is this element, when somebody presses play. It says so here
 * rather than failing silently, which is what it used to do: `play()` was called with its
 * rejection swallowed and no `error` listener at all, so a 404 left the button showing play
 * and the bar at 0:00 with no explanation.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT KNOW. Not what a line is, not how its URL is built, not which section it
 * belongs to. Quests names files by NPC and event, zones by map id and slug, and zones adds a
 * language the path itself does not carry -- so each section keeps a small adapter that turns
 * its own line into these props. That seam is the whole reason this is one component: the two
 * were the same 200 lines written twice, and they had already drifted to different playback
 * rates and different scrub behaviour.
