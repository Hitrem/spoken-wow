/**
 * Playing one recording: /api/recordings/audio?lang=deDE&source=zones&file=1411/razor-hill&version=2
 *
 * Shaped like /api/takes/audio and answered by the same serveTake: query parameters, a
 * whitelisted file, the archived name read from the row and never from the caller, and an
 * immutable answer, since a version's bytes never change. A removed recording still plays, so
 * its history can be heard.
 *
 * Behind `record`, like everything else about recordings, and so cached privately: nothing an
 * actor uploaded is public until it ships in a pack.
