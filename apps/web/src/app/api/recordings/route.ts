/**
 * A file's voice-actor recordings: list them, upload one, remove one.
 *
 *   GET    /api/recordings?lang=deDE&source=zones&file=1411/razor-hill
 *   POST   /api/recordings?lang=deDE   multipart: source, file, audio
 *   DELETE /api/recordings?lang=deDE&source=zones&file=1411/razor-hill&version=2
 *
 * All behind `record` in the language (0061): an actor hears every actor's takes there,
 * which is how they match each other. Removing is the author's, or a global admin's.
 *
 * One file per POST. The bulk drop zone sends them one after another, so a 25 MiB cap holds
 * per request and one bad file fails alone. Buffered through formData() as the voice samples
 * route is; nginx's limit for /api/recordings/ is set to match (deploy/web/nginx-spoken.conf).
